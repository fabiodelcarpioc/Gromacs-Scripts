Bunch of scripts to automatize Gromacs 2024.04 minimization, nVT, nPT and Molecular dynamics simulations.

| Script-Directory | Function | Requisites | 
|---|---|---|
| Solo-MD | Clean protein, add native hydrogens to residues, minimize before solvatation, neutralize with Na/Cl to phisiological conditions. Run minimization (1 KJ/molÂ·nm2), nVT (10 ns), NPT (10 ns) and Molecular dynamics simulation (500 ns). Correct trajectories and generate RMSD, RMSF, Gy-Rate and H-Bonds. | Protein.pdb |
